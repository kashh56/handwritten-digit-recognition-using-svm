 Project Summary: Handwritten Digit Recognition using SVM

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm. 
The model is trained on the **MNIST dataset**, a widely-used collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits. The goal is to classify these
images accurately by leveraging the power of SVM, specifically with the **Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel**.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and cleaning the data.
2. **Model Training**: Using SVM with a **GridSearchCV** approach for hyperparameter tuning (C and gamma) to achieve optimal performance.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's accuracy and making predictions on new, unseen data.
4. **Performance**: The SVM model achieves high accuracy on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in image classification tasks.

### Tools and Libraries Used:
- **Python**: The programming language for model implementation.
- **Scikit-learn**: A key library for implementing SVM and grid search for hyperparameter optimization.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the results and evaluating model performance.
